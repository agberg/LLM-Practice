"Rank 1: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Disadvantages - For consumers: Some argue that online shopping, which makes price comparison easier for customers, encourages a 'race-to-the-bottom', where retailers only compete on price, with quality and service deteriorating as a result. This is especially prevalent when comparison shopping websites such as mySupermarket allow prices to be compared without even visiting a retailer's website. The prices listed online may not match the prices listed offline. The reasons for this include mis-management, and economics (overhead cost of an online purchase and an offline purchase is different). This may result in confusion and deviations of expectations for the buyers. (Distance: 0.8026)
Rank 2: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Advantages - For consumers: A bricks and clicks business model can benefit various members of a customer base. For example, supermarkets often have different customer types requiring alternative shopping options; one group may wish to see the goods directly before purchase and like the convenience of shopping in person on short notice, while another group may require a different convenience of shopping online and getting the order delivered when it suits them, having a bricks and clicks model means both customer groups are satisfied. Other previously online-only retailers have stated that they have found benefit in adding a brick-and-mortar presence to their online-only business, as customers can physically see and test products before purchase as well as get advice and support on any purchases they have made. Additionally, consumers are likely to feel safer and have more confidence using a bricks-and-clicks business if they already know the brand from a brick-and-mortar store. Ordering and picking up has an advantage for families with children because the parents do not have to get their children out of the car. (Distance: 0.8809)
Rank 3: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Variants - "Click and collect" (at-store pick-up) - In the U.K.: In the UK, the method is known as "Click and Collect". This term was invented by British retailer Argos who already offered "Ring and Reserve" and "Text and Take Home" offerings for telephone and SMS ordering respectively, where goods would be held so the customer would pay in store. As these existing services used alliterations for their name, they needed a name for their online ordering proposition and came up with Click and Collect. British retailer John Lewis has found success in adopting a bricks and clicks business model, with the online ordering service outperforming brick and mortar sales for several years running. Online auction website eBay have also launched a scheme in cooperation with catalogue shop Argos that allows goods sold by third parties to be collected in a brick-and-mortar location, which allows the customer to collect goods at their convenience rather than wait at home for a delivery company. (Distance: 0.9174)
Rank 4: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Disadvantages - For firms: A major factor in the success or failure of this business model is in the control of costs, as usually maintaining a physical presence —paying for many physical store premises and their staffing— requires larger capital expenditure which online only businesses do not usually have. Conversely, a business selling more luxurious, often expensive, or only occasionally purchased products —like cars— may find sales are more common with a physical presence, due to the more considered nature of the purchasing decision, though they may still offer online product information. However, some car manufacturers such as Dacia have introduced online configurators that allow a customer to configure and order complete cars online, only going to a dealership to collect the completed car, which has proven popular with customers. "On the other hand, an online-only service can remain a best-in-class operation because its executives focus on just the online business." It has been argued that a bricks and clicks business model is more difficult to implement than an online only model. (Distance: 0.9342)
Rank 5: Digital economy - Digital economy - Key features - Reliance on data: By adopting common European data protection standards, the EU was able to harmonize conflicting national laws that were emerging as a trade barrier, inhibiting commerce in Europe. For this reason, GDPR and its predecessor were viewed as internal market instruments, facilitating the creation of a digital, single market by allowing an unhindered flow of data within the entire common market. Due to its ability to bridge the information asymmetry between supply and demand, data now has an economic value. When platforms compile personal data, they gather preferences and interests, which allow companies to exert a targeted action on the consumer through advertising. Algorithms classify, reference, and prioritize the preferences of individuals to better predict their behavior. (Distance: 0.9967)
Rank 6: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Variants - "Direct to boot" (curbside pickup): With the arrival of COVID-19 and consumers' desire not to enter retail stores for fear of exposure to the virus, curbside pickup took off. A variant on "Click and Collect", customers order online or by phone and pick up the merchandise, packed and ready to put in their car trunk, at the curb of the retail store or warehouse. As of September 2020 nearly 44% of U.S. retailers offered such a service. Curbside pickup sales had increased more than 500% versus the end of 2019. The strategy is also called "Buy online, pick up in store" or BOPIS. (Distance: 1.0567)"

"Rank 1: Claude Shannon - Claude Shannon - Biography - Information theory: In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the Bell System Technical Journal. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of information theory. The book The Mathematical Theory of Communication reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Warren Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. (Distance: 0.3629)

The book The Mathematical Theory of Communication reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Warren Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Weaver pointed out that the word "information" in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise. (Distance: 0.4439)
Rank 3: Claude Shannon - Claude Shannon - Biography - Information theory: This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. He further wrote a paper in 1956 regarding coding for a noisy channel, which also became a classic paper in the field of information theory. Claude Shannon's influence has been immense in the field, for example, in a 1973 collection of the key papers in the field of information theory, he was author or coauthor of 12 of the 49 papers cited, while no one else appeared more than three times. Even beyond his original paper in 1948, he is still regarded as the most important post-1948 contributor to the theory. In May 1951, Mervin Kelly, received a request from the director of the CIA, general Walter Bedell Smith, regarding Shannon and the need for him, as Shannon was regarded as, based on "the best authority" the "most eminently qualified scientist in the particular field concerned". (Distance: 0.4978)
Rank 4: Information theory - Overview: Information theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by Claude Shannon in a paper entitled A Mathematical Theory of Communication, in which information is thought of as a set of possible messages, and the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem, showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent. Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called codes, for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the channel capacity. (Distance: 0.5432)
Rank 5: Claude Shannon - Claude Shannon - Biography - Tributes and legacy: In June 1954, Shannon was listed as one of the top 20 most important scientists in America by Fortune. In 2013, information theory was listed as one of the top 10 revolutionary scientific theories by Science News. According to Neil Sloane, an AT&T Fellow who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory (now called "information theory") is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948: "He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him." (Distance: 0.5644)
Rank 6: Information theory - Historical background: The landmark event establishing the discipline of information theory and bringing it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of Claude E. Shannon's classic paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948. Historian James Gleick rated the paper as the most important development of 1948, noting that the paper was "even more profound and more fundamental" than the transistor. He came to be known as the "father of information theory". Shannon outlined some of his initial ideas of information theory as early as 1939 in a letter to Vannevar Bush. Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. (Distance: 0.5780)"

Based on the search results, I can draw some interesting connections
between information theory and modern retail:

Information theory, pioneered by Claude Shannon in 1948, is
fundamentally about the transmission and processing of information, and
reducing uncertainty in communication. Modern omnichannel retail heavily
relies on these principles in several ways:

1.  Data Flow Management: Omnichannel retail systems must handle complex
    information flows between online and physical stores, managing
    inventory, pricing, and customer data across multiple channels.

2.  Prediction and Uncertainty: Just as Shannon's theory deals with
    uncertainty in messages, retail systems use data to reduce
    uncertainty about customer behavior and preferences. The search
    results mention how "algorithms classify, reference, and prioritize
    preferences" to predict behavior.

3.  Channel Capacity: Modern retail must optimize its "channel capacity"
    across different shopping methods - from direct-to-boot to
    click-and-collect, ensuring reliable information transmission
    between systems.

Some interesting questions you might want to explore: - How has digital
transformation in retail been influenced by Shannon's information theory
principles? - What role does behavioral economics play in omnichannel
retail strategy? - How do companies like Amazon and Walmart handle the
complexity of information flow in their operations?

Remember, while information theory provides the theoretical foundation
for digital communication, its practical application in retail continues
to evolve with new technologies and customer expectations.

make that a haiku

## Assistant

Let me distill those themes into a haiku that captures the essence of
information theory in retail:

Data flows like streams Through clicks and stores it transforms Choice
meets certainty

This haiku captures Shannon's core idea of reducing uncertainty through
information, while nodding to the omnichannel retail environment's
multiple pathways.

Would you like to explore other poetic interpretations of technical
concepts in our indexed subjects? I could help you create verses about
behavioral economics, digital transformation, or Shannon's
groundbreaking theories.

## User

now summarize your initial findings more concisely than you originally
presented them

## Assistant

Information theory's principles of managing uncertainty and optimizing
data flow underpin modern retail operations. While Shannon focused on
communication channels, today's omnichannel retail applies similar
concepts: reducing uncertainty in customer behavior, managing data
across physical and digital channels, and optimizing information flow
between systems. The challenge mirrors Shannon's original problem - how
to transmit messages accurately through noisy channels, but now applied
to everything from inventory systems to consumer preferences.

This is clearer and more direct than my first response, yes? Would you
like to explore specific applications in digital commerce or dive deeper
into Shannon's foundational work?

"Rank 1: Eric Hoffer - Eric Hoffer - Books and opinions - The True Believer: Hoffer came to public attention with the 1951 publication of his first book, The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements, which consists of a preface and 125 sections, which are divided into 18 chapters. Hoffer analyzes the phenomenon of "mass movements," a general term that he applies to revolutionary parties, nationalistic movements, and religious movements. He summarizes his thesis in §113:  "A movement is pioneered by men of words, materialized by fanatics and consolidated by men of actions." Hoffer argues that fanatical and extremist cultural movements, whether religious, social, or national, arise when large numbers of frustrated people, believing their own individual lives to be worthless or spoiled, join a movement demanding radical change. But the real attraction for this population is an escape from the self, not a realization of individual hopes:  "A mass movement attracts and holds a following not because it can satisfy the desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy the passion for self-renunciation."

But the real attraction for this population is an escape from the self, not a realization of individual hopes:  "A mass movement attracts and holds a following not because it can satisfy the desire for self-advancement, but because it can satisfy the passion for self-renunciation." Hoffer consequently argues that the appeal of mass movements is interchangeable: in the Germany of the 1920s and the 1930s, for example, the Communists and National Socialists were ostensibly enemies, but sometimes enlisted each other's members, since they competed for the same kind of marginalized, angry, frustrated people. For the "true believer," Hoffer argues that particular beliefs are less important than escaping from the burden of the autonomous self. Harvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. said of The True Believer:  "This brilliant and original inquiry into the nature of mass movements is a genuine contribution to our social thought." (Distance: 0.7127)

Rank 4: Eric Hoffer - Papers: Hoffer's papers, including 131 of the notebooks he carried in his pockets, were acquired in 2000 by the Hoover Institution Archives. The papers fill 75 feet (23 m) of shelf space. Because Hoffer cultivated an aphoristic style, the unpublished notebooks (dated from 1949 to 1977) contain very significant work. Although available for scholarly study since at least 2003, little of their contents has been published. A selection of fifty aphorisms, focusing on the development of unrealized human talents through the creative process, appeared in the July 2005 issue of Harper's Magazine. (Distance: 0.9153)
Rank 5: Eric Hoffer - Eric Hoffer - Books and opinions - Later works: Subsequent to the publication of The True Believer (1951), Eric Hoffer touched upon Asia and American interventionism in several of his essays. In "The Awakening of Asia" (1954), published in The Reporter and later his book The Ordeal of Change (1963), Hoffer discusses the reasons for unrest on the continent. In particular, he argues that the root cause of social discontent in Asia was not government corruption, "communist agitation," or the legacy of European colonial "oppression and exploitation," but rather that a "craving for pride" was the central problem in Asia, suggesting a problem that could not be relieved through typical American intervention. During the Vietnam War, despite his objections to the antiwar movement and acceptance of the notion that the war was somehow necessary to prevent a third world war, Hoffer remained skeptical concerning American interventionism, specifically the intelligence with which the war was being conducted in Southeast Asia. After the United States became more involved in the war, Hoffer wished to avoid defeat in Vietnam because of his fear that such a defeat would transform American society for ill, opening the door to those who would preach a stab-in-the-back myth and allow for the rise of an American version of Hitler. (Distance: 1.0750)
Rank 6: Eric Hoffer - Working-class roots: Hoffer was influenced by his modest roots and working-class surroundings, seeing in it vast human potential. In a letter to Margaret Anderson in 1941, he wrote: "My writing is done in railroad yards while waiting for a freight, in the fields while waiting for a truck, and at noon after lunch. Towns are too distracting." He once remarked, "my writing grows out of my life just as a branch from a tree." When he was called an intellectual, he insisted that he simply was a longshoreman.

Based on the search results, here's how they might react:

Byrne, with his art-meets-technology sensibility, might see omnichannel
retail as a fascinating system of human behavior and machine logic
colliding - like a complex song where digital signals and human desires
create unexpected harmonies.

Hoffer would likely view it more skeptically. He'd see the mass movement
toward digital commerce as another example of people seeking escape from
individual choice - ironically through systems designed to offer more
choices. He might note that the "true believers" in digital
transformation are often more invested in the movement itself than its
actual benefits.

Together, they'd probably agree that the human element in these systems
is more interesting than the technology itself. Would you like to
