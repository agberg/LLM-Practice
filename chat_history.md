"Rank 1: Information theory - Historical background: The landmark event establishing the discipline of information theory and bringing it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of Claude E. Shannon's classic paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948. Historian James Gleick rated the paper as the most important development of 1948, noting that the paper was "even more profound and more fundamental" than the transistor. He came to be known as the "father of information theory". Shannon outlined some of his initial ideas of information theory as early as 1939 in a letter to Vannevar Bush. Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. (Distance: 0.5284)
Rank 2: Biography - Tributes and legacy: In June 1954, Shannon was listed as one of the top 20 most important scientists in America by Fortune. In 2013, information theory was listed as one of the top 10 revolutionary scientific theories by Science News. According to Neil Sloane, an AT&T Fellow who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory (now called "information theory") is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948: "He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him." (Distance: 0.5421)
Rank 3: Biography - Information theory: This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. He further wrote a paper in 1956 regarding coding for a noisy channel, which also became a classic paper in the field of information theory. Claude Shannon's influence has been immense in the field, for example, in a 1973 collection of the key papers in the field of information theory, he was author or coauthor of 12 of the 49 papers cited, while no one else appeared more than three times. Even beyond his original paper in 1948, he is still regarded as the most important post-1948 contributor to the theory. In May 1951, Mervin Kelly, received a request from the director of the CIA, general Walter Bedell Smith, regarding Shannon and the need for him, as Shannon was regarded as, based on "the best authority" the "most eminently qualified scientist in the particular field concerned". (Distance: 0.5504)
Rank 4: Biography - Information theory: In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the Bell System Technical Journal. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of information theory. The book The Mathematical Theory of Communication reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Warren Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. (Distance: 0.6403)
Rank 5: Commemorations - Shannon centenary: The Shannon centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916. It was inspired in part by the Alan Turing Year. An ad hoc committee of the IEEE Information Theory Society including Christina Fragouli, Rüdiger Urbanke, Michelle Effros, Lav Varshney and Sergio Verdú, coordinated worldwide events. The initiative was announced in the History Panel at the 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop Jerusalem and the IEEE Information Theory Society newsletter. A detailed listing of confirmed events was available on the website of the IEEE Information Theory Society. (Distance: 0.6547)
Rank 6: Information theory - Historical background: Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as H = log Sn = n log S, where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, which since has sometimes been called the hartley in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers. Much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of thermodynamics by Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs. Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by Rolf Landauer in the 1960s, are explored in Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory.

Rank 6: Information theory - Historical background: Shannon outlined some of his initial ideas of information theory as early as 1939 in a letter to Vannevar Bush. Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation W = K log m (recalling the Boltzmann constant), where W is the speed of transmission of intelligence, m is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and K is a constant. Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as H = log Sn = n log S, where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission.

And here's a fascinating historical note: Before Shannon's groundbreaking work, there were early attempts to understand information mathematically. Ralph Hartley, in 1928, was the first person to treat "information" as a measurable quantity, creating a formula to calculate it. His work was so significant that a unit of information was named after him - the "hartley." Also interesting is that Alan Turing used similar ideas in 1940 to help break the German Enigma codes during World War II!

These discoveries and innovations continue to influence our modern digital world, from the smartphones we use to the way we process and transmit information. It's amazing to think that so much of our current technology can be traced back to these pioneering minds!

"Rank 1: Information theory - Overview: Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem, showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent. Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called codes, for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the channel capacity. These codes can be roughly subdivided into data compression (source coding) and error-correction (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both codes and ciphers). (Distance: 0.8499)
Rank 2: Information theory - Overview: Information theory studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty. In the case of communication of information over a noisy channel, this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by Claude Shannon in a paper entitled A Mathematical Theory of Communication, in which information is thought of as a set of possible messages, and the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise. Shannon's main result, the noisy-channel coding theorem, showed that, in the limit of many channel uses, the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity, a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent. Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called codes, for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the channel capacity.

Rank 4: Information theory - Information theory - Quantities of information - Entropy of an information source: Other bases are also possible, but less commonly used. For example, a logarithm of base 28 = 256 will produce a measurement in bytes per symbol, and a logarithm of base 10 will produce a measurement in decimal digits (or hartleys) per symbol. Intuitively, the entropy HX of a discrete random variable X is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the value of X when only its distribution is known. The entropy of a source that emits a sequence of N symbols that are independent and identically distributed (iid) is N ⋅ H bits (per message of N symbols). If the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent, the entropy of a message of length N will be less than N ⋅ H.

If one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s), and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver (has a specific value with certainty) ahead of transmission, it is clear that no information is transmitted. (Distance: 0.9172)
Rank 5: Information theory - Information theory - Applications to other fields - Intelligence uses and secrecy applications: Information theoretic concepts apply to cryptography and cryptanalysis. Turing's information unit, the ban, was used in the Ultra project, breaking the German Enigma machine code and hastening the end of World War II in Europe. Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the unicity distance. Based on the redundancy of the plaintext, it attempts to give a minimum amount of ciphertext necessary to ensure unique decipherability. Information theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear. (Distance: 0.9467)

After analyzing the search results, I can identify several fascinating common threads between these topics:

1. **Information Processing and Computing**: All these subjects revolve around how information is processed, stored, and transmitted. Shannon's information theory provided the theoretical foundation for digital communication, while Hillis created machines that could process this information in powerful new ways. The Connection Machine that Hillis built was actually used for many applications that involved processing large amounts of information, including cryptography - a field that Shannon had also worked on!

2. **Revolutionary Impact on the Digital Age**: Both Shannon and Hillis made contributions that were fundamental to our modern digital world. Shannon's theories made digital communication possible, and every device with a microprocessor is considered a "descendant" of his work. Similarly, Hillis's innovations in parallel computing influenced modern computing, and some of his ideas (like the "datacenter in a box" concept) are still used today.

3. **Problem-Solving Through Mathematics and Computing**: Both Shannon and Hillis approached complex problems through mathematical and computational thinking. Shannon developed mathematical formulas to understand information transmission, while Hillis created physical machines to solve complex computational problems.

4. **Cryptography and Security**: Interestingly, both Shannon's information theory and Hillis's Connection Machine had applications in cryptography. Shannon's work included fundamental concepts about code-breaking and security, while the Connection Machine was used for cryptographic applications among its many uses.

5. **Foundation for Future Innovations**: Both men's work laid groundwork that others built upon. For example, Sergey Brin, who later founded Google, used Hillis's Connection Machine, while Shannon's information theory continues to be fundamental to all digital communication and computing.

The intersection of these topics really shows how theoretical concepts (Shannon's information theory) and practical implementations (Hillis's computers) came together to help create our modern digital world. It's a perfect example of how theoretical and applied computer science work together to drive innovation!
