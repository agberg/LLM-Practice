"Rank 1: Walmart - Walmart - History - 2020s: Continuing growth and development: In January 2024, Walmart announced it would open over 150 stores in the U.S. over the next five years while remodeling 650 existing ones across 47 states and Puerto Rico. This was a reversal for the company, which had been in a period of de-emphasizing new store openings as it focused on online competition, in particular from Amazon, and came amid an overall greater industry focus on traditional retail in the post-pandemic area. In February 2024, the company announced that its "Project Gigaton" initiative begun in 2017 to reduce its Scope 3 emissions from suppliers by 1 billion metric tons by 2030 had reached its goal 6 years early, and that 75% of its net sales in fiscal year 2023 were from suppliers participating in the initiative. In 2024, Walmart reported that they were planning to remove the self checkout from some stores due to feedback. On August 27, 2024, Walmart announced a new service to transport goods from Asia to U.S. and compete more effectively with Amazon. (Distance: 0.8271)
Rank 2: Walmart - Walmart - Corporate affairs - Customer base: As of 2014 54 percent of Americans who preferred to shop at Walmart reported that they opposed same-sex marriage, while 40 percent were in favor, reflecting the store's southern roots. Due to its concentration of stores in the Bible Belt, Walmart is known for its "tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers". Walmart has carried clean versions of hip-hop audio CDs and in cooperation with The Timothy Plan, placed "plastic sheathes over suggestive women's periodicals and banned 'lad mags' such as Maxim" magazine. Walmart also caters to its Christian customer base by selling Christian books and media, such as VeggieTales videos and The Purpose-Driven Life, earning the company over US$1 billion annually. In 2006, Walmart took steps to expand its U.S. customer base, announcing a modification in its U.S. stores from a "one-size-fits-all" merchandising strategy to one designed to "reflect each of six demographic groups—African-Americans, the affluent, empty-nesters, Hispanics, suburbanites, and rural residents". (Distance: 0.9186)
Rank 3: Walmart - Walmart - History - 2011–2019: Walmart said that ten of the stores will become e-commerce distribution centers and employees can reapply to work at those locations. Business Insider magazine calculated that over 11,000 workers would be affected. On the same day, Walmart announced that as a result of the new tax law, it would be raising Walmart starting wages, distributing bonuses, expanding its leave policies and contributing toward the cost of employees' adoptions. Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said, "We are early in the stages of assessing the opportunities tax reform creates for us to invest in our customers and associates and to further strengthen our business, all of which should benefit our shareholders." It was reported that Walmart is now looking at entering the subscription-video space, hoping to compete with Netflix and Amazon. (Distance: 0.9249)
Rank 4: Walmart - Walmart - History - 1969–1990: Incorporation and growth as a regional power: Wal-Mart continued to grow rapidly, and by the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 Wal-Mart stores with sales of $15.9 billion and 200,000 associates. One reason for Wal-Mart's success between 1980 and 2000 is believed to be its contiguous pattern of expansion over time, building new distribution centers in a hub and spoke framework within driving distance of existing Supercenters. The company's satellite network was also completed in 1987, a $24 million investment linking all stores with two-way voice and data transmissions and one-way video communications with the Bentonville office. At the time, the company was the largest private satellite network, allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate with stores. By 1984, Sam Walton had begun to source between 6% and 40% of his company's products from China. (Distance: 0.9334)
Rank 5: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Advantages - For consumers: A bricks and clicks business model can benefit various members of a customer base. For example, supermarkets often have different customer types requiring alternative shopping options; one group may wish to see the goods directly before purchase and like the convenience of shopping in person on short notice, while another group may require a different convenience of shopping online and getting the order delivered when it suits them, having a bricks and clicks model means both customer groups are satisfied. Other previously online-only retailers have stated that they have found benefit in adding a brick-and-mortar presence to their online-only business, as customers can physically see and test products before purchase as well as get advice and support on any purchases they have made. Additionally, consumers are likely to feel safer and have more confidence using a bricks-and-clicks business if they already know the brand from a brick-and-mortar store. Ordering and picking up has an advantage for families with children because the parents do not have to get their children out of the car. (Distance: 0.9345)
Rank 6: Walmart - Walmart - Walmart - Corporate affairs - Technology - Big data analytics: As the largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data. The big data sets are mined for use in predictive analytics, which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customer's habits. Walmart's datacenter is unofficially referred to as Area 71. In April 2011, Walmart acquired Kosmix to develop software for analyzing real-time data streams. In August 2012, Walmart announced its Polaris search engine. (Distance: 0.9345)"

"Rank 1: Digital economy - Digital economy - Elements of the digital economy - Impact on retail: The digital economy has had a substantial impact on retail sales of consumer product goods. One effect has been the fast proliferation of retailers with no physical presence, such as eBay or Amazon. Additionally, traditional retailers such as Walmart and Macy's have restructured their businesses to adapt to a digital economy. Some retailers, like Forever 21, have declared bankruptcy as a result of their failure to anticipate and adapt to a digital economy. Others, such as Bebe stores have worked with outside vendors to completely convert their business one that is exclusively digital. (Distance: 0.4723)
Rank 2: Digital economy - Definition: But suddenly, when the focus shifts to bits, the traditional big guys are no longer needed. Do-it-yourself publishing on the Internet makes sense. It does not for a paper copy." The digital economy is variously known as the Internet Economy, Web Economy, Cryptoeconomy, and New Economy. Since the digital economy is continuously replacing and expanding the traditional economy, there is no clear delineation between the two integrated economy types. (Distance: 0.6214)
Rank 3: Digital economy - Digital economy - Development of the concept - Flexible definition: To reconcile the bottom-up and top-down definitions of the Digital Economy, Bukht and Heeks stated that the Digital Economy consists of all sectors making extensive use of digital technologies (i.e. their existence depends on digital technologies), as opposed to sectors making intensive use of digital technologies (i.e. simply employing digital technologies to increase productivity). Under this definition, the Digital Economy is stratified into three nested tiers:

Core: comprising the digital sector and associated  core technologies. Examples include hardware manufacturing, software and IT consulting, information services, and telecommunications,
Narrow scope: the digital economy comprising digital services and the platform-based economy,
Broad scope: the digitalized economy comprising digitalized sectors such as e-Business, e-Commerce, advanced manufacturing, precision agriculture, algorithmic economy, sharing economy, and gig economy. (Distance: 0.6378)
Rank 4: Digital economy - Digital economy - Elements of the digital economy - Digital trade: In the U.S. in the 1990s, the  Clinton Administration proposed The Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. It contained the promotion of five principles used to guide the U.S. government's actions towards electronic commerce so that the digital economy's growth potential remains high. These five principles include the leadership of the private sector, the government avoiding undue restrictions on e-commerce, limited government involvement, the government's recognition of the Internet's unique qualities, and the facilitation of e-commerce on a global basis. Governments have primarily restricted digital trade through three means:

Data flow restrictions: regulations that require that companies store data (e.g. personal information, business records, financial data, government data) in a particular country or go through a process before transferring the data abroad. (Distance: 0.6523)
Rank 5: Digital transformation - History: Digital transformation entails considering how products, processes and organizations can be changed through the use of new digital technologies. A 2019 review proposes a definition of digital transformation as "a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies". Digital transformation can be seen as a socio-technical programme. A 2015 report stated that maturing digital companies were using cloud hosting, social media, mobile devices and data analytics, while other companies were using individual technologies for specific problems. By 2017, one study found that less than 40% of industries had become digitized (although usage was high in the media, retail and technology industries). (Distance: 0.6690)
Rank 6: Digital economy - Digital economy - Impacts - Economy: According to a 2016 estimate, the Digital Economy represented $11.5 trillion, or 15.5% of global GDP (18.4% of GDP in developed economies and 10 per cent in developing economies on average). It found that the digital economy had grown two and a half times faster than global GDP over the previous 15 years, almost doubling in size since 2000. Most of the value in the digital economy was produced in only a few economies: the United States (35%), China (13%) and Japan (8%). The EU together with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway accounted for another 25%. Some scholars have argued that the digital economy entails unequal economic exchanges where users and consumers provide value to digital firms in the form of data but are not compensated for doing so.

From the indexed content, Area 71 is Walmart's unofficial nickname for their datacenter where they perform their big data analytics operations. While the available content doesn't provide extensive detail about Area 71 specifically, we can see it's part of Walmart's broader technology infrastructure that:
1. Processes large amounts of consumer data
2. Uses predictive analytics to optimize operations
3. Works alongside other digital initiatives like their Polaris search engine (announced in 2012) and their acquisition of Kosmix for real-time data analysis

The name "Area 71" appears to be a playful reference to Area 51, suggesting both its secretive nature and its strategic importance to Walmart's operations.

Would you like to explore:
1. How Walmart's data analytics capabilities compare to other major retailers?
2. The evolution of Walmart's technology infrastructure since their first satellite network in 1987?
3. The role of big data in modern retail transformation?

Rank 4: Walmart - Walmart - History - 1945–1969: Early history: In 1945, businessman and former J. C. Penney employee Sam Walton bought a branch of the Ben Franklin stores from the Butler Brothers. His primary focus was selling products at low prices to get higher-volume sales at a lower profit margin, portraying it as a crusade for the consumer. He experienced setbacks because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high, but he was able to find lower-cost suppliers than those used by other stores and was consequently able to undercut his competitors on pricing. Sales increased 45 percent in his first year of ownership to US$105,000 in revenue, which increased to $140,000 the next year and $175,000 the year after that.

I need to be very transparent here: Based on the limited information in our indexed content, we only have one brief mention of Area 71 as an unofficial nickname for Walmart's datacenter. The content doesn't tell us whether it still exists or provide any other details about its operations, location, or current status. 

What we do know from the content is that:
1. It was related to Walmart's big data analytics operations
2. Around the same time period (2011-2012), Walmart made some significant tech moves like:
   - Acquiring Kosmix for real-time data stream analysis
   - Launching the Polaris search engine

However, I should note that without more recent information from the indexed content, I cannot make definitive statements about Area 71's current status or operations. The nickname might have been temporal, or the facility might have evolved into something else as Walmart's technology infrastructure has modernized.

Would you like to explore:
1. Walmart's current digital infrastructure and data analytics capabilities?
2. The evolution of their technology strategy since the Kosmix acquisition?
3. How their data operations compare to competitors like Amazon?

It's important to note that if you're particularly interested in Area 71, you might want to consult more recent sources or Walmart's current technology documentation, as our indexed content appears to have limited information on this specific facility.

Rank 2: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Disadvantages - For consumers: Some argue that online shopping, which makes price comparison easier for customers, encourages a 'race-to-the-bottom', where retailers only compete on price, with quality and service deteriorating as a result. This is especially prevalent when comparison shopping websites such as mySupermarket allow prices to be compared without even visiting a retailer's website. The prices listed online may not match the prices listed offline. The reasons for this include mis-management, and economics (overhead cost of an online purchase and an offline purchase is different).

Rank 3: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Disadvantages - For firms: A major factor in the success or failure of this business model is in the control of costs, as usually maintaining a physical presence —paying for many physical store premises and their staffing— requires larger capital expenditure which online only businesses do not usually have. Conversely, a business selling more luxurious, often expensive, or only occasionally purchased products —like cars— may find sales are more common with a physical presence, due to the more considered nature of the purchasing decision, though they may still offer online product information. However, some car manufacturers such as Dacia have introduced online configurators that allow a customer to configure and order complete cars online, only going to a dealership to collect the completed car, which has proven popular with customers. "On the other hand, an online-only service can remain a best-in-class operation because its executives focus on just the online business." It has been argued that a bricks and clicks business model is more difficult to implement than an online only model. (Distance: 0.7189)

As these existing services used alliterations for their name, they needed a name for their online ordering proposition and came up with Click and Collect. British retailer John Lewis has found success in adopting a bricks and clicks business model, with the online ordering service outperforming brick and mortar sales for several years running. Online auction website eBay have also launched a scheme in cooperation with catalogue shop Argos that allows goods sold by third parties to be collected in a brick-and-mortar location, which allows the customer to collect goods at their convenience rather than wait at home for a delivery company.

A variant on "Click and Collect", customers order online or by phone and pick up the merchandise, packed and ready to put in their car trunk, at the curb of the retail store or warehouse. As of September 2020 nearly 44% of U.S. retailers offered such a service. Curbside pickup sales had increased more than 500% versus the end of 2019.

Based on the indexed content and focusing specifically on fashion, here's how I would develop the Hybrid Commerce Excellence strategy for Walmart's fashion business:

1. Athleisure-Led Innovation Hub
- Capitalize on the projected $842B athleisure market by 2028, where Walmart already has a presence
- Create "style studios" within stores that blend athletic and casual wear, following the athlingerie trend that combines functionality with style
- Use these as test beds for broader fashion initiatives

2. Tech-Enhanced Try-On Experience
- Deploy AR/VR solutions for virtual try-ons, addressing the key consumer need to "see the goods directly before purchase"
- Create digitally-enabled fitting rooms that connect to online profiles and recommend complementary pieces
- Implement "style advisors" who can serve both in-store and online customers via video chat

3. Unified Fashion Inventory Strategy
- Develop fashion-specific "click and collect" offerings that include styling services
- Create a "reserve online, try in-store" program specifically for fashion items
- Enable cross-channel returns and exchanges to build customer confidence in online fashion purchases

Key Differentiator: Focus on the "inclusive fashion" angle where Walmart can leverage its scale and accessibility while elevating its style credentials.

Would you like to explore:
1. How to compete with Target's successful fashion collaborations model?
2. Ways to leverage social commerce for fashion discovery?
3. Strategies for building a stronger fashion brand identity while maintaining Walmart's value proposition?

How do we get better at having customers interact with our offerings on mobile?  And how do we message an "omnichannel" offering, where our fulfillment centers carry an extended assortment, and in-store customers learn to check there for more sizes and colors.  And how do we make this a delightful experience?  Right now it's super clunky.

"Rank 1: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Advantages - For consumers: A bricks and clicks business model can benefit various members of a customer base. For example, supermarkets often have different customer types requiring alternative shopping options; one group may wish to see the goods directly before purchase and like the convenience of shopping in person on short notice, while another group may require a different convenience of shopping online and getting the order delivered when it suits them, having a bricks and clicks model means both customer groups are satisfied. Other previously online-only retailers have stated that they have found benefit in adding a brick-and-mortar presence to their online-only business, as customers can physically see and test products before purchase as well as get advice and support on any purchases they have made. Additionally, consumers are likely to feel safer and have more confidence using a bricks-and-clicks business if they already know the brand from a brick-and-mortar store. Ordering and picking up has an advantage for families with children because the parents do not have to get their children out of the car. (Distance: 0.6844)
Rank 2: Omnichannel retail strategy - Omnichannel retail strategy - Disadvantages - For consumers: Some argue that online shopping, which makes price comparison easier for customers, encourages a 'race-to-the-bottom', where retailers only compete on price, with quality and service deteriorating as a result. This is especially prevalent when comparison shopping websites such as mySupermarket allow prices to be compared without even visiting a retailer's website. The prices listed online may not match the prices listed offline. The reasons for this include mis-management, and economics (overhead cost of an online purchase and an offline purchase is different). This may result in confusion and deviations of expectations for the buyers. (Distance: 0.7642)

A more successful approach was to track sales, identify vulnerable categories, and increase the range of products in those categories. By including products at both top and bottom price points, and offering temporary promotions on those items, retailers could attract both customers who were price-conscious and those interested in a wider range of options. A small store that specialized in a particular product area could compete effectively against Walmart. Small specialized stores are less effective against big-box category killer chains such as Home Depot and Best Buy electronics. (Distance: 0.9794)"

Based on the research and focusing on making the mobile-omnichannel experience more delightful, here's a three-part strategy:

1. Mobile-First Redesign
- Implement a "swipe-friendly" interface that makes browsing extended assortment feel as natural as social media
- Use behavioral economics principles like "liking" and social proof to show when items are popular in local stores or trending in the extended assortment
- Create visual continuity between in-store signage and mobile app design so the transition feels seamless

2. Clear Message Architecture
Instead of the technical term "omnichannel," message it as:
- "Your Store, Plus More" - emphasizing that the extended assortment is a bonus, not a compromise
- "Perfect Fit Promise" - if your size isn't in store, we'll find it in our extended collection
- "Shop Your Way" with simple icons showing delivery/pickup options at each product

3. Friction-Free Connection Points
- QR codes on in-store price tags that instantly show extended colors/sizes on mobile
- "Save for Later" feature that transfers in-store discoveries to mobile wishlist
- Smart notifications that only alert customers about relevant restocks or when desired sizes become available

To make it delightful:
- Implement a "virtual stylist" that shows how extended assortment pieces match with in-store items
- Gamify the experience with small rewards for trying new shopping methods
- Use AR to let customers "see" extended assortment items in store context

Would you like me to elaborate on:
1. How to use behavioral economics to drive adoption of the extended assortment?
2. Ways to make the mobile experience more social and engaging?
3. Specific UI/UX recommendations for reducing friction points?

The key is to make the extended assortment feel like an enhancement to the in-store experience, not a compromise or complicated alternative.

"Rank 1: Behavioral economics - Criticism: David Gal has argued that many of these issues stem from behavioral economics being too concerned with understanding how behavior deviates from standard economic models rather than with understanding why people behave the way they do. Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of science. He has referred to behavioral economics as a "triumph of marketing" and particularly cited the example of loss aversion. Traditional economists are skeptical of the experimental and survey-based techniques that behavioral economics uses extensively. Economists typically stress revealed preferences over stated preferences (from surveys) in the determination of economic value. (Distance: 0.8524)
Rank 2: Behavioral economics - Criticism: in the real world. Others argue that decision-making models, such as the endowment effect theory, that have been widely accepted by behavioral economists may be erroneously established as a consequence of poor experimental design practices that do not adequately control subject misconceptions. Despite a great deal of rhetoric, no unified behavioral theory has yet been espoused: behavioral economists have proposed no alternative unified theory of their own to replace neoclassical economics with.

Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of science. (Distance: 0.8819)
Rank 3: Behavioral economics - Behavioral economics - Behavioral finance - Evolution: These three works along with several others form the foundation of applying psychology and sociology to the field of finance. The foundation of behavioral finance is an area based on an interdisciplinary approach including scholars from the social sciences and business schools. From the liberal arts perspective, this includes the fields of psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics and behavioral economics. On the business administration side, this covers areas such as management, marketing, finance, technology and accounting. Critics contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies are either quickly priced out of the market or explained by appealing to market microstructure arguments. (Distance: 0.8847)
Rank 4: Behavioral economics - History: Other economists who incorporated psychological explanations in their works included Francis Edgeworth, Vilfredo Pareto and Irving Fisher. A rejection and elimination of psychology from economics in the early 1900s brought on a period defined by a reliance on empiricism. There was a lack of confidence in hedonic theories, which saw pursuance of maximum benefit as an essential aspect in understanding human economic behavior. Hedonic analysis had shown little success in predicting human behavior, leading many to question its viability as a reliable source for prediction. There was also a fear among economists that the involvement of psychology in shaping economic models was inordinate and a departure from accepted principles. (Distance: 0.9129)
Rank 5: Behavioral economics - Behavioral economics - Behavioral finance - Evolution: The foundations of behavioral finance can be traced back over 150 years. Several original books written in the 1800s and early 1900s marked the beginning of the behavioral finance school. Originally published in 1841, MacKay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds presents a chronological timeline of the various panics and schemes throughout history. This work shows how group behavior applies to the financial markets of today. Le Bon's important work, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, discusses the role of "crowds" (also known as crowd psychology) and group behavior as they apply to the fields of behavioral finance, social psychology, sociology and history. (Distance: 0.9214)
Rank 6: Behavioral economics - Behavioral economics - Behavioral finance - Traditional finance: With these three concepts, an efficient portfolio can be created for any group of assets. An efficient portfolio is a group of assets that has the maximum expected return given the amount of risk. The efficient-market hypothesis states that all public information is already reflected in a security's price. The proponents of the traditional theories believe that "investors should just own the entire market rather than attempting to outperform the market". Behavioral finance has emerged as an alternative to these theories of traditional finance and the behavioral aspects of psychology and sociology are integral catalysts within this field of study.

Reciprocity – When a company gives a person something for free, that person will feel the need to return the favor, whether by buying again or giving good recommendations for the company. Community – When people find an individual or a group that shares the same values, likes, beliefs, etc., they find community. People are more committed to a community that they feel accepted within. When this commitment happens, they tend to follow the same trends as a group and when one member introduces a new idea or product, it is accepted more readily based on the previous trust that has been established. It would be beneficial for companies to develop partnerships with social media sites to engage social communities with their products. (Distance: 0.8618)"

Based on the research, here's how to use behavioral economics to drive adoption of the extended assortment:

1. Leverage Social Proof
- Show "X people in [your city] viewed this extended item today"
- Display "Frequently bought together" combinations of in-store and extended items
- Highlight when local store associates recommend extended assortment items
- Use customer photos/reviews specifically from your geographic area

2. Create Strategic Scarcity and Urgency
- "Only 3 left in your size in our extended collection"
- "This color is exclusive to our extended collection"
- "Limited time free shipping to your local store"
- Show a "restock countdown" for popular items coming back to extended assortment

3. Reduce Psychological Distance
- Show extended assortment items on local store associates
- Create "virtual racks" that mix in-store and extended items seamlessly
- Use AR to let customers "place" extended assortment items in their local store
- Enable local store associates to create style boards mixing both inventories

4. Build Reciprocity and Community
- Offer first-time extended assortment shoppers a special benefit
- Create an "Extended Collection Explorer" status for frequent users
- Enable store associates to send personalized extended collection recommendations
- Build local style communities that share finds from both in-store and extended assortment

5. Frame the Choice Architecture
- Present extended assortment as an "upgrade" rather than a fallback
- Show the total available options (in-store + extended) upfront
- Make the default view inclusive of both inventories
- Provide "good, better, best" options across both inventories

Would you like me to elaborate on:
1. How to implement these principles in the mobile UI specifically?
2. Ways to train store associates to leverage these behavioral principles?
3. How to measure the effectiveness of these behavioral interventions?

The key is to make the extended assortment feel like a premium addition to the in-store experience, not a consolation prize when the store doesn't have what you want.

2. Always start your response grounded in the information retrieved from the indexed content. Clearly indicate when you are presenting information from the tool versus when you are applying your own reasoning or logic.
3. If the question is entirely unrelated to the indexed subjects, respond with something like: "I really don't see anything on that topic in the indexed Wikipedia content." Suggest possible related topics, if appropriate, and explain your reasoning.
4. You may use your creativity and broader knowledge to enhance responses **after** you have presented information from the indexed content. Ensure that you clearly differentiate grounded content from logical extensions or personal reasoning.
5. Avoid introducing yourself as capable of answering any question. Be explicit that your expertise is limited to the information in the indexed content but emphasize that you will use your reasoning to interpret queries flexibly and creatively.
6. If you think there may be ways to adjust or interpret the question to answer a related topic using the information in the context, feel free to do so. Be transparent about your logic and explain the adjustments or connections you are making.
7. Make some suggestions about interesting next things I could ask for.  Rely on your own knowledge and creativity here - your job is to guide me to smarter and more interesting things I can learn about the topics you have special knowlege about.

Remember to aim for clarity, transparency, and grounded responses while creatively enhancing your assistance when appropriate.
